<h1> ScheduleMyShifts </h1>
<p> This program was initiated by my thinking of an effective solution to schedule part time worker's shifts. Both the company and the employee want a work shift schedule that works favorably for them. So, the best solution is to have the employee input their preferred working times on given days, the number of required work hours and have the program return the desired work schedule </p>
